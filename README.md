# rap-builder
Alpha version of a Hackathon project aimed at allowing the creation of RAP files within the Visual Studio build. At this time there is no support for this project. If you are interested, reach out to the Developer Experience team at Relativity.

The rap-builder project uses the sample-application project to test with which can be cloned here: git@github.com:relativitydev/sample-application.git .

Note: We are not open-sourcing the source code for kCura.RAPBuilder.exe
