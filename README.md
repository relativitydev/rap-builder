# rap-builder
Alpha version of a Hackathon project aimed at allowing the creation of RAP files within the Visual Studio build. At this time there is no support for this project. If you are interested, reach out to the Developer Experience team at Relativity.

The rap-builder project uses the sample-application project to test with which can be cloned here: git@github.com:relativitydev/sample-application.git .

When set up properly this will create a rap file for a custom solution that contains applicaiton schema, event handlers, and agents.  Other types of extensibility points may work but have not been tested.  If you find one that does not work, please create an issue and feel free to jump in and fix. 

Note: We are not open-sourcing the source code for kCura.RAPBuilder.exe
